# A Generic Static Helper Bot.

Currently, it only works for one static since it only has access to it's own sheets. But in the future using Oauth2 from Google spreadsheets the idea is to make it more accessible for all statics 

## Current Features: 
- Uploading Logs to the "Raid Logs" sheet of the Static sheet. 

## Future Features: 
- Showing a list of all historic runs with the best times and the worst times, etc etc.
- Showing what roles people are supposed to play. 
- Making the bot Available to multiple statics. 
- More To be Added!
  
This project definitely has a lot of potential if worked on correctly, So I plan to work on it for a few months until I make a site and release it :)
